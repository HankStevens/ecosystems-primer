@Rastetter:1992ab proposed a model of multiple-element limitation of vegetation growth (MEL). @Rastetter:1997aa extended that to include soil pools. We replicate this here. It is similar to our model of [@Bormann1977], but now includes both carbon and nitrogen.^[Rastetter et al. introduce a couple terms that make my skin crawl, and I will do my best to explain them, and avoid them where I can.]

By now, you've had some practice working with models, so take a gander at this one (Fig. \@ref(fig:rf1)). 

```{r rf1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="*Fig. 1 from Rastetter et al. 1997. Variables $B$, $E$, and $D$ elements in vegetation biomass, inorganic form (e.g., soil solution, or atmospheric CO$_2$), and organic form in soil detritus. Variable $V_i$ is allocation related to nutrient acquistion. $U$ is uptake by vegetation or microbes in detritus (broadly defined), $R_N$ is deposition, and $L_N$ is loss via leaching or denitrification. $R$ is renewal into the inorganic pools. The little triangles or bowties on fluxes refer to some rate-controlling function; $B$ and $V$ exchange information (dotted lines) that influences fluxes. Other terms are explained in the Table below.*", out.width='100%' }

```

MEL uses the parameter $A$ for "acclimation", which we can think of as *compensation* by vegetation that is associated with homeostatic responses to resource supply rates that differ from a stoichiometric ideal. *Acclimation* has a perfectly good meaning in ecophysiology, which is short- to near-term reversible physiological adjustment in response to changing conditions. In MEL, "acclimation" is much broader, and this early version, it means shifts in the relative rates of C and N accumulation in vegetation, resulting in and from changes in the C:N ratio of vegetation. This occurs due to the ratio of wood to non-woody tissue, defined by $q$.

Compensatory dynamics by vegetation, or "acclimation", is a very important part of this model. "Vegetation" is a complex adaptive system that undergoes diverse changes across many time scales. This could happen through physiological, ecological, and evolutionary changes in plant species composition, ratios of root, stem, leaves and reproductive structures, or changes in tissue C:N ratios. "Acclimation" covers a range of responses with very different time scales, and the variable $A$ is how these changes are incorporated into this ecosystem model. In a later section, we explore the meaning and implications of MEL acclimation.

In MEL, vegetation "acclimates" through differential allocation to carbon vs. nitrogen uptake functions. Rastetter et al. refers to this as uptake "effort". They use this anthropomorphic term "effort" for a pattern of allocation, as in "...increasing uptake effort to acquire limiting soil nutrients." MEL uses the state variables, $V_C$ and $V_N$, to represent this "effort" or allocation of uptake of C and N respectively. In a later section, we explore the meaning and implications of MEL effort.

Both vegetation and microbes acclimate in MEL, in a manner inversely proportion to the relative concentrations of nutrients. In both vegetation and microbes, this results in a tendency toward maintenance of optimal C:N ratios. However, the model handles them differently. It assumes that the acclimation in vegetation is slow while the acclimation in microbes is instantaneous.

Here we write out the model nearly as written in Rastetter et al. (1997), but with some reordering. By default, R is an *interpreted language* rather than a *compiled language*. What that means for us is that R processes commands one line at a time. Therefore, if a function F requires parameter x, we have to make sure parameter x is defined before we define F. In our implementation of MEL below, `Mc` requires `Ucm`, so `Ucm` needs to be defined before `Mc`.  

Copy this into a new script and name it 'mel2.R'. In that script, add more comments to those I started. When you save that script, you can use `source('mel2.R')` to load the function.
```{r}
mel2 <- function(time, y, p){
  with(as.list(c(y,p)), {
    ## Carbon is 1 and Nitrogen is 2 in 
    ## E - inorganic; D - soil organic w/ microbes; B - veg biomass;  
    ## V - acclimation

    Ucm <- alpha_c*Ec/(k_cm + Ec) * psi*Dn * (theta*Dn)/Dc  # alpha_c=0
    
    ## Microbial consumption
    ## nutrient availability + gross uptake
    Mc <- psi*Dc + Ucm
    Mn <- psi*Dn + Unm
    
    Alpha_c <- epsilon_c * theta*Mn/(Mc + theta*Mn)
    Alpha_n <- epsilon_n * Mc/(Mc + theta*Mn)
    
  
    ## C:N ratio (units of C)
    q <- q_w*Bc/(k_q + Bc)
    
    ## SURFACE area related to nutrient acquisition (0 < z < 1)

    ## REPLENISHMENT to the inorganic pools (R)

    Vstar <- (A > 0) * Vc + (A < 0) * Vn 
    dV_C <- -1*a*A*Vstar
    dV_N <- -1 * dV_C
    
    ## Auxiliary ecosystem variables
    NPP <- Ucv - Rcv
    Net_N_uptake <- Unv - Rnv
    Ecosystem_N=Bn+En+Dn
    Ecosystem_C=Bc+Ec+Dc
    
    return(list(c(dE_C, dE_N, dB_C, dB_N, dD_C, dD_N, dV_C, dV_N),
                NPP=NPP, Net_N_uptake=Net_N_uptake,
                Ecosystem_C=Ecosystem_C) )
  })
}
```

Here we start with a vector of model parameters whose description and units are found in Table 1 above. The numeric values come from Table 2 in Rastetter et al. (1997). You should copy these into your own script, and then add your own comments to each parameter, as I started to.
```{r}
## Parameter set for a closed ecosystem
p.c <- c(
  # carbon, nitrogen
  Rce=0, Rne=0, # no renewal from outside the ecosystem 
  gc=1116, gn =23.77,
  rc=0.02055, rn=0.01955, 
  mc=0.02055, mn=0.08009,
  kc=350, kn=5,
  zc=0.11, zn=0.16,
  epsilon_c=0.6, epsilon_n=0.6471,
  alpha_c=0, alpha_n = 0.01092,
  k_cm = 1, k_nm=1, 
  beta_ce = 0, 
  beta_ne = 0,
  
  # Other
  a=5, 
  tau=3, # damping coef
  q_w=439, 
  k_q=26290,
  theta=8.628,
  psi=0.04321,
  beta_d=0
)
```

**Exercise** To help you better grasp what is going on in the model, redraw Fig. \@ref(fig:rf1) on a chalkboard or a larger piece of paper and add as much detail as you can fit. Include model parameters and definitions and explanations -- whatever helps you make sense of the processes, and their mathematical representation.

## Implementing MEL
Table 2 of Rastetter et al. also include initial values for the state variables, which we include here.
```{r}
init.states <- c(Ec=350, En=1, # Inorganic nutrients g/m^2
            Bc=22000, Bn=110, # Biomass nutrients g/m^2
            Dc=13000, Dn=521, # Detritus nutrients g/m^2
            Vc=0.5, Vn=0.5 # allocation "effort" unitless
            )
```

In addition to initial values of state variables, @Rastetter:1997aa (Table 2) list initial fluxes. We don't have to worry about those; the model calculates the initial fluxes from parameters and from initial values of the state variables.

### Increasing atmospheric carbon with events in `ode()`
Rastetter et al. (1997) double CO$_2$ concemntrations at an early time point in their simulations. We do that using an `events` in the `ode()` function. 

An "event" in an `ode()` model the value of a state variable changes suddenly at a one or more time points. In one sense, these are like ecological disturbances. For instance, we could add 1 kilogram of phosphorus to a lake in a one-time pulse, or halve primary producer biomass at 10 random times over a one hundred year interval. 

We can create events using either a function, or with a data frame. Here we create a data frame, using the required four variables: 

* 'var' selects the state variable to change. 
* 'time' is the time at which the event occurs.
* 'value' is the numeric value associated with the change.
* 'method' is the operator that operates on the 'value' and the state variable: 'add' will add the value to the state variable, 'mult' will multiply the state variable by the value, and 'replace' will simply replace the state variable with the value (the value can be a positive or negative number).
```{r}
event.df <- data.frame(var="Ec", time=0.005, value=2, method="mult")
```
This event will double atmospheric carbon concentration very shortly after the start of the simulation.

We will run the model for 1000 years as in Rastetter et al. (1997), and specify that R return values for a logarithm series of time steps.
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
## 10^3 = 1000 years
t=10^seq(-3, 3, by=.001)
```

Next we run the model using parameters for a closed ecosystem, and a partly open system [@Rastetter:1997aa]. 
```{r}
## Closed ecosystem 
out.c <- ode(init.states, t, func=mel2, parms=p.c,
          events=list(data=event.df) )

## Partly open
p.o <- p.c
p.o["Rne"] <- 1
p.o["beta_ne"] <- 1
out.o <- ode(init.states, t, func=mel2, parms=p.o, 
          events = list(data = event.df) )
```

You will probably get a warning message that R has included our event time into the integration procedure. That is a good thing.

Next we convert the simulation data sets, add variables, combine, rearrange, and plot the results.  
```{r, fig.cap="*Simulated dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in an ecosystem with both C- and N-limitation, in a closed and partly open ecosystem. Recreates Fig. 3 from Rastetter et al. (1997), in part.*", out.width="100%"}
out.c <- out.c %>% as.data.frame() %>% mutate(N.cycle = "closed")
out.o <- out.o %>% as.data.frame() %>% mutate(N.cycle = "open")

out.all <- rbind(out.c, out.o)

outL <- pivot_longer(out.all, cols=-c(time, N.cycle),
                     names_to="State_var", values_to="g.sq.m")

ggplot(outL, aes(x=time, y=g.sq.m, colour=N.cycle)) + geom_line() + 
  scale_x_log10() + facet_wrap(~State_var, ncol=3, scales="free")
```

Cool, right?
