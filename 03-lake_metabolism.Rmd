# Lake Metabolism

In this chapter, you'll study how lakes breath. You'll get real data from Acton Lake, graph the data to see what it looks like, and then measure the rate of an inhale and an exhale. You'll do a simple, small example to get an idea, and then using an R package, `LakeMetabolizer`, which is designed to do the same thing and much more.

## Estimating Productivity

Most cells respire to do the work of growth and maintenance by consuming oxygen and using it as the final electron acceptor when O$_2$ is reduced, creating water. Because individuals comprise cells, and ecosystems comprise individuals, ecosystems respire too, and we can measure their metabolic rate using oxygen consumption and production.

We measure whole ecosystem metabolic rate as net ecosystem productivity which is the difference between gross primary productivity and respiration. Putting all of this in the same units of oxygen allows us to measure the rate,
$$NEP = GPP - R_{\mathrm{total}}$$
where $R_{\mathrm{total}}=R_A+R_H$, or total respiration. Limnologists assume that, due to stoichiometric relations, rates of photosynthesis, respiration, and net primary production are correlated with rates of change in dissolved oxygen. Therefore, we can estimate respiration and net primary production by quantifying changes in oxygen concentration over time.  Dissolved oxygen in the water column (DO) is relatively easy to measure, therefore it is relatively easy to estimate NEP. If we assume that respiration is constant throughout the 24 h cycle, we estimate GPP as the sum of NEP and R. This is known are the free-water dissolved oxygen method of estimating NEP, R and GPP.

Using DO, we can estimate NEP and R, and then calculate GPP as the sum of NEP and R. Because we think about lake NEP as *metabolism*, we will use units of $R$, $NEP$, and $GPP$ as mg$\cdot$mL$^{-1}$$\cdot$h$^{-1}$.

* the rate $R$ is  the slope of DO vs. time at nighttime (when photoautrophs stop fixing carbon).
* the rate $NEP$ is the slope of DO vs. time during the day (when photoautrophs are fixing carbon and respiration continues unabated).
* the rate $GPP$ is $GPP = NEP + R_{\mathrm{total}}$ 

## By hand, in R

Remember to start by loading the `tidyverese` and `deSolve` packages in R.

Let's practice R by importing, wrangling, and graphing data, then calculating slopes and estimating respiration, NPP, and GPP. 

Start by obtaining data for Acton Lake (`acton.csv`). Place it inside a folder labelled 'data' inside your working directory. Here you read in data and check whether it loaded properly.
```{r}
## Either change the path name in this function, or
## make sure you have a folder named 'data' inside your working directory
acton <- read_csv("data/acton.csv", 
                  ## tell R the format of one of your variables
         col_types = cols(date_time = 
                            col_datetime(format = "%m/%d/%y %H:%M")), 
    skip = 1# skips the first line of metadata
    )

# acton <- read_csv("data/acton.csv", 
#                   ## tell R the format of one of your variables
#          col_types = cols(date_time = 
#                             col_character()), 
#     skip = 1 # skips the first line of metadata
#     )
# acton$date_time <- as.POSIXlt(acton$date_time, 
#                               format="%m/%d/%y %H:%M")
# summary(acton$date_time)
# acton <- acton %>%
#   mutate(date_time = mdy_hm(date_time))
# summary(acton)
# library(lubridate)
# date_time <- mdy_hm(acton$date_time)
# summary(date_time)
```
Let's check our understanding of lake oxygen dynamics by plotting the time series. Ggplot understands what to do with dates.
```{r, fig.cap="*Oxygen dynamics from Acton Lake."}
ggplot(acton, aes(x=date_time, y=O_mg.L)) + geom_path() 
```

If we want to calculate the slope of the night time oxygen concentration, then we should identify what the endpoints of "day time" are so that we can do analyses on just daylight or nighttime data.

Working with times in R is a little tricky, because times and dates, periods, durations, and intervals are inherently tricky. The `date_time` variable in the original data set contains all the information, and we extra tidbits from it.
```{r}
# determine day/night intervals
## Sunrise
morning <- 6.25
## sunset
evening <- 21


acton <- mutate(acton,
                ## dates, as factors.
                date = as.factor( format(date_time, "%Y-%m-%d", tz="America/New_York") ),
                ## hour in decimal format
                hour.d = as.integer( format(date_time, "%H")) + 
                  as.numeric(format(date_time, "%M"))/60,
                ## just the daylight hours
                daytime.d = 
                  ifelse(hour.d >= morning & hour.d < evening, 
                         hour.d - morning, NA),
                ## just the nighttime hours
                nighttime.d = 
                  ifelse( hour.d >= evening, hour.d-evening, 
                          ifelse(hour.d < morning, 
                                 24 - evening + hour.d, NA)),
                ## an indicator of whether it is day or night
                daylight = as.factor(
                  ifelse(hour.d >= morning & hour.d < evening, "day", "night"))
                )

## identify different day/night cycles, one cycle = one day
## first measurement of the day 
( first <- which(acton$hour.d==6.25) )

## day 1 is in rows 1-96, day 2 is in rows 97-192, etc.
( rows.per.day <- diff(first) )
## there are 96 observations of each cycle
## make a new categorical variable, day
acton <- acton %>%
  mutate(day=as.factor( rep(1:7, each=96)))

```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
table(acton$date)
x <- 1:nrow(acton)
qplot(x=x, y=date_time, data=acton, geom="line")
```


The slope of oxygen concentration at night is respiration, $R$. The slope of the oxygen concentration during the day is gross primary production minus respiration, or net ecosystem production.

We will pull out one day's worth of data and make a **q**uick plot of the time series.
```{r}
acton2 <- filter(acton, day=="1")
## or 
# library(lubridate)
# acton2 <- filter(acton,  
#                  date_time >=ymd_hms("2013-06-27 06:15:00") & 
#                    date_time <= ymd_hms("2013-06-28 06:00:00") )

qplot(x = date_time, y=O_mg.L, data=acton2, geom = "path")
```

The nighttime slope is the regression line for just the nighttime data

```{r}
# select the data frame, filter for 'date' values within a range of dates
names(acton2)
night.R <- lm(O_mg.L ~ nighttime.d, data=acton2)
## intercept and slope of nighttime regression
coef(night.R)

day.NEP <- lm(O_mg.L ~ daytime.d, data=acton2)
## intercept and slope of daytime regression
coef(day.NEP)

```

To calculate time-averaged, 24 hour NEP, we assume that all GPP occurred during the day, and respiration is constant. Our day is 14 h 45 min, or 14.75.
```{r}
## as.numeric() drops the name of the slope we used
R24 <- as.numeric( abs( coef(night.R)[2] ) )
NEP24 <- as.numeric( coef(day.NEP)[2] * 14.75/24 )
GPP24 <- NEP24 + R24
R24; NEP24; GPP24
```
These units are mg O$_2$ / L / h.

Here is what every night looks like. 
```{r}
nights <- filter(acton, daylight=="night")
ggplot(nights, aes(x=nighttime.d, y=O_mg.L, colour=day, linetype=day)) + 
  geom_point() + # plot points
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) # fit linear models each night
```

We can calculate the average slope for all nights, forcing a straight line through each night's data. The estimates of uncertainty and the P values won't make sense because the data are horribly autocorrelated, but we can rely on the estimates of the coefficients, and the average slope, in particular.
```{r}
ntd <- acton$nighttime.d/24
m.resp <- lm(O_mg.L ~ nighttime.d + day, data=acton)
night.O2.rate <- coef(m.resp)["nighttime.d"]
night.O2.rate 
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
m.resp <- lm(O_mg.L ~ -1 + day + nighttime.d:day, data=acton)
summary(m.resp)
```


The estimate for `night.d`, ```r round(coef(m.resp)[2],3)```, is our estimate of the respiration rate in mg_O$_2$/L per hour. We usually report this per day, which would just be 24 times as great.

Here is what each day looks like. Recall the at daytime oxygen increase is GPP-R or NEP.
```{r}
days <- filter(acton, daylight=="day")
ggplot(days, aes(x=daytime.d, y=O_mg.L, colour=day)) + 
  geom_point() + # plot points
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) # fit linear models each night
```

If we want to, we could throw out the days that have negative slopes, that is, days 6 and 7.
```{r}
acton3 <- filter(acton, !(day == 6 | day == 7) ) # NOT day 6 OR 7
md.resp <- lm(O_mg.L ~ daytime.d + day, data=acton3)
NEP.day <- coef(md.resp)["daytime.d"]
NEP.day
```
To get 24 hour NEP, we have to weight daytime and nighttime GPP by the daylength. We stipulated that our morning began at 6:15 AM and ended at 9 PM, or a day time of 14 h 45 min, or about 61% of the 24 h cycle. Also, remember that respiration is positive, even though we are measuring it with a negative slope.
```{r}
NEP24 <- as.numeric( NEP.day * 14.75/24 )
R24 <- as.numeric( abs( night.O2.rate ) )
GPP24 <- NEP24 + R24 # as.numeric drops the element name
GPP24
```

Recall these are units of mg O$_2$ / L / h. For units per day, we have
```{r}
c(GPP24, NEP24, R24) * 24
```

## The LakeMetabolizer package
Here we do something similar but in a much more sophisticated way. To estimate the net ecosystem productivity, we need to know, at least, gas exchange rates, equilibrium oxygen saturation, the mixing depth, and the daylight hours.

The `metab` function in `LakeMetabolizer` calculates GPP, R, and NEP given requisite data. The function can use several different approaches, depending upon what data you have and your quantitative preferences. Here we use the simplest approach, which the authors refer to as simple bookkeeping. First we load the package and then examine the help page for `metab.bookkeep`. 
```{r eval=TRUE}
# install.packages("LakeMetabolizer", dep=TRUE)
library(LakeMetabolizer)
?metab.bookkeep
```
On the help page you learn about how to use this function. Here we walk through the steps for acquiring or making educated guesses about the data we need.

Here we acknowledge that the change in dissolved oxygen is a function of NEP and also the flux of oxygen due to diffusion,
$$\Delta \mathrm{DO} = \mathrm{NEP}_{t-1} \cdot \Delta t + F_{t-1}$$
where $F_{t-1}$ is the flux of oxygen due to diffusion [@winslow2016a]. This rate of diffusion depends on wind speed, temperature, lake size, and, ultimately, how much the of the lake waters mix [@winslow2016a]. Here we will simply provide a value for the gas exchange constant and a mixing depth.

From its calculations, LakeMetabolizer can give us NEP, R, and GPP. This is because average respiration is the average difference between DO and $F$,  and NEP is the difference between GPP and R. 

LakeMetabolizer needs data in a particular form, and so we build that next.
```{r}
## pick a reasonable gas exchange constant and mixing depth
k.gas <- 0.4
z.mix <- 3 # meters of well mixed surface waters

## let midday PAR be 1300 mol photons/m^2/sec at water surface

## estimate 
### dissolved oxygen at saturation (equilibrium) using the function, o2.at.sat.base()
### irradiance in PAR

acton.LM <- acton %>% 
  mutate(
  do.sat=o2.at.sat.base(temp, altitude=283), #saturated DO
    day= as.numeric(is.day(date_time, lat=39.5)), # day vs. night
  par = 1300 * sin(daytime.d/14.5 * pi), # PAR
  irr = ifelse(is.na(par), 0, par), # recode par to make night = 0
  z.mix = z.mix, # add mixing depth
    k.gas = k.gas, # add gas exchange coefficient
  wtr=temp # rename observed water temperature
  ) %>%
  ## select only some of the columns
  select(datetime=date_time,
         do.obs=O_mg.L, do.sat=do.sat,
         k.gas=k.gas, z.mix=z.mix, irr=irr, wtr=wtr) %>%
  as.data.frame() # simplify the data structure (class tbl_df screws things up)
```

One of the methods in LakeMetabolizer, 'bookkeep', requires irradiance to be 0 or 1. We make a new data set with that.
```{r}
acton.bk <- acton.LM %>%
  mutate(irr = as.numeric( irr>0 ) ) # converts TRUE/FALSE to 1,0
```

Finally, we use three different methods to estimate GPP, R, and NEP.
```{r}
## calculate GPP, R, NEP in mg O2 / L / day
out.b <- metab(acton.bk, method="bookkeep")
out.k <- metab(acton.LM, method="kalman")
out.m <- metab(acton.LM, method="mle")

## combine data sets - first label each dataset
out.b$method <- "bookkeep"
out.k$method <- "kalman"
out.m$method <- "mle"
## now combine
out.all <- full_join(
  full_join(out.b, out.k),
  out.m)
## ... and stack the variables into a long form
out.l <- out.all %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=GPP:NEP)

ggplot(out.l, aes(doy, value, color=method)) + geom_line() +
  facet_grid(.~name)
```

How does this compare with our previous estimate? What would happen if our gas exchange constant differs (Cole et al. 2010)?
