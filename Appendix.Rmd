# Appendix: Build a model of your own system

Background Readings:

* This primer: at least chapters 1-3; chapters 5-6, 8-9 are also useful.
* Soetaert and Hermann 2009. All of it is useful, but especially the chapters ued in this primer.

## Steps

1. Identify scope, including,
   a. state variables (with units),
   a. inputs and outputs for the system, 
   a. fluxes between state variables,
   a. the state variables upon which the fluxes depend (e.g., litterfall from trees to soils depends directly on only trees but not soils), 
   a. spatial boundaries, and
   a. time scale, or temporal boundaries. 
1. Create budget, including,   
   a. amount in each state variable,
   a. annual fluxes between state variables; if you can't find these in the literature, figure out ways to get very rough approximate estimates.
1. Write out a model, including,
   a. write out explicit rate equations for each state variable,
   a. calculate instantaneous rates, derived from *annual fluxes* and the size of the state variables upon which the fluxes depend.
1. Code the model in R, including,
   a. writing an ODE function, a vector of parameters; start with three or four years only.
   a. run and then troubleshoot the model.
1. Perform sensitivity analysis (chap. 6).
1. Consider including data from an external source (chap. 9)
1. Consider letting R try to fit rate parameters through optimization (chap. 8).
1. Present your findings in a simple written form and short oral presentation.
