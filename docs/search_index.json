Their book is an excellent source for those interested in ecosystem modeling. We will use bits of it along with this online text to get a little more comfortable with ecosystem processes and models. References "],["intro.html", "2 Introduction to ecosystem modeling 2.1 Why models? 2.2 What’s an ecosystem? 2.3 What’s a model? 2.4 Steps in modeling", " 2 Introduction to ecosystem modeling Reading: pp. 1-17, (Chapters 1, 2; Soetaert and Hermann 2009) In this course, we’ll cover the very basics of ecosystem modeling. There are several goals I have for you, the reader. I hope the you, become more fluent in the discipline of ecosystem ecology; that you understand and can use basic terminology, and can identify quantitative pieces of the literature you read, and presentations you hear and see; understand and describe the quantitative and qualitative features of ecosystem dynamics and models of those dynamics; assess the relative merits of different modeling approaches and different mathematical formalisms of those apporaches; create models of ecosystem dynamics of your own; write R code to implement ecosystem models. To do all this, the following text relies heavily on selected secondary sources including Soetaert and Herman (2009) and Haefner (1996). I also cite selected primary soruces where appropriate. 2.1 Why models? In general, models are simplifications of reality. Useful models capture something useful about the reality we are interested in. A road map is a useful model of a road network. It captures just what we need. We model to aid understanding, because, at some level, the model is a quantitative and qualitative explanation for some phenomenon (Fig. 2.1). We can use models to test hypotheses, guide experiments, and predict manage ecosystems and populations (Soetaert and Herman 2009). Figure 2.1: We use conceptual and mathematical models to interpret reality. (Fig. 1.3 in Soetaert and Hermann, 2009). 2.2 What’s an ecosystem? You can find definitions of an ecosystem elsewhere, but here we want to emphasize the abstraction of that ecosystem (Fig. 2.2). We will think of an ecosystem as a set of one or more compartments containing some mass of an element of interest, such as carbon or nitrogen. That element is the currency of the ecosystem. These compartments (aka pools, stocks) are connected by fluxes, or flows, the transfer of some mass of the element. When these transfers come from outside the ecosystem entirely, we refer to them as imports. When the transfer exits the system entirely, we refer to it as an exports. Figure 2.2: An ecosystem perspective of lake (Carpenter et al. 1992). Boxes are ecosystem compartments and the quantities are pools (a.k.a. stocks, units are mass per unit area or volume). Arrows are fluxes (units are mass per unit time. Ecosystem fluxes or flows are influenced by state factors such as temperature, time, or disturbance which act as constraints that can limit or speed up the fluxes or determine the current states of the variables (Fig. 2.3). Figure 2.3: The current state of an ecosystem depends on state factors (Chapin III, Matson, and Mooney 2002). 2.3 What’s a model? You’ve already seen ecosystem models. An ecosystem model consists of the compartments and fluxes we saw above. We refer to the currencies in different compartments as variables because they can vary or change through time. We use mathematical equations and computational controls to represent fluxes between compartments. In the equations, there are constants that we call parameters that control the rate of these fluxes. State factors also enter into the model, typically altering the fluxes. For instance, increasing atmospheric temperature might force a predictable change in a parameter that controls the loss of soil nitrogen into the atmosphere. Because temperature is an external factor forcing a change to a parameter, we often call its role in a model a forcing function. To review: variables are quantities that change with time, such as the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, or the amount of phosphorus in the primary producers in a lake. Parameters are (typically) constants in equations that quantify how quickly the variables change. Forcing functions represent state factors that we think of as external to the ecosystem compartments. No models apply everywhere, all the time. All models are limited for a specific domain and with specific boundaries. These are the spatial, temporal and conceptual limits on a model. 2.3.1 Other ideas Statistical models (e.g., regression) are concerned with describing patterns and hypothesis testing. Process models (e.g., stock and flow models) are also descriptions of natural systems, but they include more mechanism and seek to describe mechanism and understand process. People sometimes call these mechanistic models. Figure 2.4: A statistical model of aboveground plant biomass as a function of available soil nitrogen. A theory is a well supported hierarchical framework that contains clearly formulated postulates, based on a minimal set of assumptions, from which a set of predictions logically follows (Marquet et al. 2014). Efficient theory is based to as much as possible on first principles, and relies on as few assumptins as possible. In contrast to theory, models are specific implementations of theory and specific descriptions of nature. Remember that in principle, all models are wrong, but some are useful1. Exercise: Ask yourself whether a lake is a carbon sink or a source. Draw an appropriate compartment model to address this question. After having done so, ask yourself what assumptions you’ve made about the temporal and spatial scales. What mechanisms have you included? Why? 2.4 Steps in modeling Soetaert and Herman (2009) identify a series steps that guides model development and ultimately improve understanding and prediction (Fig. 2.5). Figure 2.5: It is helpful to use a series of steps in improving our models. (Figure 1.7 in Soetaert and Hermann, 2009).

Figure 3.2: A simpler compartment model for Hubbard Brook Watershed 6, based on Bormann et al. (1977). 3.1 Getting started (S&amp;H 15-17) For any ecosystem, we want to start with paper and pencil and sketch out the pools and the fluxes that we think are important (see example, Fig. 3.2). Don’t sweat the details yet – you’ll revise it anyway. Go ahead an label the compartments and the fluxes with with both biological and physical processes as well as some simple abstract notation. Write balance equations (S&amp;H, 3, 17-20). For each flux, identify the underlying biological and physical processes. If you don’t completely know, don’t sweat it. Here are the balance equations for Fig. 3.2: Rate of change of vegetation = uptake - exudates and through fall - leaf and root litter loss \\[\\frac{dV}{dt} = f_1 - f_2 - f_3\\] Rate of change in available pool in soil solution = bulk precip + exudates and through fall + net mineralization - uptake - stream export \\[\\frac{dA}{dt} = I_1 + f_2 + f_4 - f_1 - E_1\\] Rate of change in the bound pool = net N fixation + leaf and root litter loss - net mineralization - stream export \\[\\frac{dB}{dt} = I_2 + f_3 - f_4 - E_2\\] Assess the total load or mass budget (S&amp;H, 19-22). For Fig. 3.2, we have \\[\\frac{d\\left(V+A+B\\right)}{dt} = \\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{dA}{dt} + \\frac{dB}{dt} = (f_1 - f_2 - f_3) + (I_1 + f_2 + f_4 - f_1 - E_1) + (I_2 + f_3 - f_4 - E_2)\\] \\[\\frac{d\\left(V+A+B\\right)}{dt} = I_1 + I_2 + f_1 - f_1 + f_2 - f_2 + f_3 - f_3 + f_4 - f_4 - E_1 - E_2\\] \\[\\frac{d\\left(V+A+B\\right)}{dt} = I_1 + I_2 - E_1 - E_2\\] From this we see that the total mass budget for this watershed depends simply on import or inputs, and exports or outputs. For each flux, decide which pools directly influence the flux. In a forest, the flux of nitrogen from vegetation to soil will depend enormously on the amount of vegetation present as leaves senesce and fall, fine roots die back, and water leaches nutrients out of leaves and bark. The flux is very unlikely to depend directly on the amount of nitrogen already in the soil. In a lake, the flux of phosphorous from the water column into phytoplankton depends on the amounts of both the amount of phytoplankton and the amount of phosphate in the water at any given instant. For the vegetation pool in Fig. 3.2, we see each flux (\\(f\\)) is a Function (\\(F()\\)) of one or two pools: Uptake: \\(f_1 = F(V,A)\\) Leaf and root litter, and throughfall: \\(f_3 = F(V)\\) Root exudates, and throughfall: \\(f_4 = F(V)\\) Next, we want to represent these fluxes in a mathematical form. 3.2 First mathematical form for plant uptake A common starting point for dynamics depending on two pools is the law of mass action. This states that the reaction rate is proportional the product of the pools. In the case of plant uptake of N, which depends on the amounts of N in the available pool and the vegetation pool, this would be \\(aVA\\), where \\(a\\) is a proportionality constant. In some circumstances, these pools might also have exponents different than one (\\(aV^1A^1\\)), such as \\(aVA^2\\). This occurs in chemistry when a reaction requires two molecules of “A” for each molecule of “V”. It might occur in ecology if a rate depends differentially on A and B. Using the law of mass action for plant uptake, we will describe the fluxes in the simple N budget above (Fig. 3.2) with the following expressions. \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{dV}{dt} &amp;= a_{1}AV - a_{2}V - a_3 V\\\\ \\frac{dA}{dt} &amp;= I_1 + a_{2}V + a_{4}B - a_{5}A - a_{1}AV\\\\ \\frac{dB}{dt} &amp;= I_2 + a_{3}V - a_{4}B - a_{6}B \\end{align}\\] Take the time to identify each term and think about the biology or physics that might govern each term. 3.3 Paramaterization Parameteriztion is what we call assigning numerical values to mathematical parameters. Here, we find initial estimates for the parameters in our model. We use the literature for this purpose (Bormann, Likens, and Melillo 1977). If we have the data (we do) and relatively simple mathematical forms (we do), it is fairly straightforward to estimate parameters. For instance, we decided that net mineralization would be directly proportional to the size of the organic pool, \\(B\\), that is, \\(F_4 = a_4B\\). To calculate \\(a_4\\), we substitute data where we can, and solve what we need. \\[\\begin{align*} F_2 &amp;= a_4 B\\\\ 69.6 &amp;= a_4 4700 \\\\ a_4 &amp;= \\frac{69.6}{4700}\\\\ a_4 &amp;\\approx 0.015 \\end{align*}\\] We use the same approach for second order equations as well.

We solve the model. With simple models, we can sometimes find analytical solutions. For most ecosystem models, we have to solve the models numerically using numerical integration. Here we write a function that includes our system of differential equations. This will allow R to integrate change through time. bormann1 &lt;- function(t, y, p) { # time, vector of state variables and parameters must be in this order # we can use as.list for both the state variables and parameters # a1 = uptake # a2 = loss from veg to avail # a3 = loss from veg to bound # a4 = net mineralization # a5 = export from avail # a6 = export from bound with( as.list( c(y, p) ), { dV.dt &lt;- a1 * A * V - a2 * V - a3 * V dA.dt &lt;- i1 + a2 * V + a4 * B - a1 * A * V - a5 * A dB.dt &lt;- i2 + a3 * V - a4 * B - a6 * B # Here we return a list whose first element is the vector of # rates of change for the state variables.

We will define the initial state of the system, and then tell R which time point we want it to return. The initial state of the system is the set of starting values for the state variables. We could choose any values, but I select the values given in Bormann, Likens, and Melillo (1977). initial.state &lt;- c( V = 532, A = 26, B = 4700) 3.5 Calibration, take 1 Calibration, in general, is the process of finding better estimates for our parameters. We can do that by looking into the literature, or by using independent data to estimates parameters directly. If we take a look at the model output (above), we see both differences and similarities with Bormann et al. What are they?

(1977). In some ways, we have been moderately successful in our first pass at converting a purely budgetary model into a dynamic process model. We mimicked total load, and see similar changes through time of all the state variables. Questions to ponder We replicated approximately the N budget of Bormann et al. (1977), but clearly vegetation cannot keep accumulating N indefinitely. What are our next steps? One logical step is to assume that as vegetation eventually gets limited by some factor or resource that is not in our model. If, at first approximation, the vegetation reaches a carrying capacity independent of high resource availability, we can use an approximation suggested by Soetaert and Hermann (2009) for self-limitation, \\[f(X)V\\left(1-\\frac{V}{K}\\right)\\] where \\(f(X)\\) is everything else that regulates mass-specific growth rate. Exercise Include self-limitation in your model of vegetation, estimate \\(K\\), and produce output. 3.6 Budget, take II Remember that following our template, we have a maximum rate times resource and self limitation, and inhibition. Currently, we have \\[\\frac{dV}{dt} = a_{1}AV - a_{2}V - a_3 V\\] and rearranging, \\[\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\left(a_{1}A - a_{2} - a_3\\right) V\\] If we add self-limitation, we get \\[\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\left(a_{1}A - a_{2} - a_3\\right) V \\left(1-\\frac{V}{K}\\right)\\] where \\(K\\) is the maximum amount of live vegetation that the ecosystem can sustain, in kg,N,ha\\(^{-1}\\). We don’t know exactly what that is yet, but we may be able to get estimates from the literature. For know we can pretend that it is just a bit more than was there in the mid-1970s, say, \\(K=600\\). Now we rewrite the R function with self-limitation. bormann2 &lt;- function(t, y, p) { # time, vector of state variables and parameters must be in this order # we can use as.list for both the state variables and parameters # a1 = uptake # a2 = loss from veg to avail # a3 = loss from veg to bound # a4 = net mineralization # a5 = export from avail # a6 = export from bound with( as.list( c(y, p) ), { dV.dt &lt;- (a1 * A - a2 - a3) * V * (1-V/K) dA.dt &lt;- i1 + a2 * V + a4 * B - a1 * A * V - a5 * A dB.dt &lt;- i2 + a3 * V - a4 * B - a6 * B # Here we return a list whose first element is the vector of # rates of change for the state variables.

Unlike our first model of this system, we see state variables on curved trajectories and perhaps reaching asymptotes. This makes greater intuitive sense - over the short term, it is the same as the simple N budget shown in Bormann, Likens, and Melillo (1977) and it also shows a reasonable longterm trajectory for the vegetation, and the predicted consequences for the available and bound pools.

(???) extended that to include soil pools. We replicate this here. It is similar to our model of (Bormann, Likens, and Melillo 1977), but now includes both carbon and nitrogen.2 By now, you’ve had some practice working with models, so take a gander at this one (Fig. 5.1). Figure 5.1: Fig. 1 from Rastetter et al. 1997. Variables \\(B\\), \\(E\\), and \\(D\\) elements in vegetation biomass, inorganic form (e.g., soil solution, or atmospheric CO\\(_2\\)), and organic form in soil detritus. Variable \\(V_i\\) is allocation related to nutrient acquistion. \\(U\\) is uptake by vegetation or microbes in detritus (broadly defined), \\(R_N\\) is deposition, and \\(L_N\\) is loss via leaching or denitrification. \\(R\\) is renewal into the inorganic pools. Other terms are explained in the Table below. Figure 5.2: Table 1 (Rastetter et al 1997). MEL uses the parameter \\(A\\) for “acclimation”, which we can think of as compensation by vegetation. Acclimation has a perfectly good meaning in ecophysiology, which is short- to near-term reversible physiological adjustment in response to changing conditions. In MEL “acclimation” means shifts in the relative rates of C and N accumulation in vegetation, resulting in and from changes in the C:N ratio of vegetation. This could happen through physiological, ecological, and evolutionary changes in plant species composition, ratios of root, stem, leaves and reproductive structures, or changes in tissue C:N ratios. “Acclimation” covers a range of responses with very different time scales. MEL uses the state variables, \\(V_C\\) and \\(V_N\\), to represent allocation of uptake of C and N respectively. They use the anthropomorphic term “effort” for this pattern of allocation, as in “…increasing uptake effort to acquire limiting soil nutrients.” Starting with the parameters.
