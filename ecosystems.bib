@article{Rastetter:1992ab,
	abstract = {{In this paper we present a simple model of multiple-element limitation
   of plant production and biomass accumulation. The primary aim of this
   model is to develop a theoretical framework for examining
   multiple-element limitation vs. single-element limitation and for
   examining the relationship between short-term and long-term responses to
   changes in element availability. In the model we assume that there is an
   ``optimal{''} ratio of mineral elements in vegetation biomass, and that
   the vegetation continually adjusts its relative element uptake
   capacities to compensate for shifts away from this optimum. We examine
   the responses of this model to changes in element availability in the
   plant environment, where ``availability{''} is defined either as fixed
   concentrations of non-depletable elements or as fixed replenishment
   rates of depletable elements.
   The model results suggest that the nature of the controls on element
   availability has a major impact on whether single- or multiple-element
   limitation prevails, even when plants can acclimate so as to maintain an
   ``optimal{''} nutritional balance. Single-element limitation occurs when
   the replenishment rate of an essential element to the available pool is
   limited and sustainable plant uptake of that element equals the
   replenishment rate. Furthermore, when single-element limitation
   prevails, there is little or no correlation between short-term responses
   to a change in element availability and long-term, equilibrium
   responses.
   In general, previous experimental studies and models of plant growth in
   response to changes in relative availability of multiple, essential
   elements have either not specified how those resources are controlled,
   or have examined only one type of control. Our results help to explain
   the diversity of results of past studies of multiple-element limitation,
   suggest some improvements in experimental design for future studies, and
   have important implications for the extrapolation of the results of
   controlled experiments to field situations.}},

@article{Rastetter:1997aa,
	abstract = {{Ecosystem responses to increased CO, are often constrained by nutrient
   limitation. We present a model of multiple-element limitation (MEL) and
   use it to analyze constraints imposed by N on the responses to an
   instantaneous doubling of CO2 concentration in a 350-yr-old eastern
   deciduous forest. We examine the effects of different exchange rates of
   inorganic N with sources and sinks external to the ecosystem (e,g.,
   through deposition and leaching) and different initial ratios of
   net:gross N mineralization. Both of these factors influence the
   availability of N to vegetation and, therefore, have important effects
   on ecosystem responses to increased CO2. We conclude that reliable
   assessments of ecosystem responses to CO2 will require a better
   understanding of both these factors. The responses to increased CO2
   appear on at least four characteristic time scares. (1) There is an
   instantaneous increase in net primary production, which results in an
   increase in the vegetation C:N ratio. (2) On a time scale of a few
   years, the vegetation responds by increasing uptake effort for available
   N (e.g., through increased allocation of biomass, energy, and enzymes to
   fine roots). (3) On a time scare of decades, there is a net movement of
   N from soil organic matter to vegetation, which enables vegetation
   biomass to accumulate. (4) On the time scale of centuries, ecosystem
   responses are dominated by increases in total ecosystem N, which enable
   organic matter to accumulate in both vegetation and soils. In general,
   short-term responses are markedly different from long-term responses.}},

@article{Marquet2014,
	abstract = {We argue for expanding the role of theory in ecology to accelerate scientific progress, enhance the ability to address environmental challenges, foster the development of synthesis and unification, and improve the design of experiments and large-scale environmental-monitoring programs. To achieve these goals, it is essential to foster the development of what we call efficient theories, which have several key attributes. Efficient theories are grounded in first principles, are usually expressed in the language of mathematics, make few assumptions and generate a large number of predictions per free parameter, are approximate, and entail predictions that provide well-understood standards for comparison with empirical data. We contend that the development and successive refinement of efficient theories provide a solid foundation for advancing environmental science in the era of big data.},
